# License Plate Detection Models: Comprehensive Comparison

This document provides a detailed comparison between two approaches for license plate detection:
1. Custom CNN Model (from scratch)
2. YOLOv8-based Model (transfer learning)

## 1. Data Preprocessing

### Custom CNN Approach
- **Image Resizing**: All images resized to 416×416 pixels using `cv2.INTER_AREA` interpolation method (better quality preservation)
- **Pixel Normalization**: Pixel values normalized to [0,1] range by dividing by 255
- **Bounding Box Transformation**: 
  - Original bounding boxes converted from absolute (x, y, w, h) to normalized format [0,1]
  - Coordinates scaled proportionally to the image resize ratio
  - Format: [x/width, y/height, w/width, h/height]
- **Batch Processing**: Data processed in smaller batches to reduce memory usage
- **No Data Augmentation**: The custom CNN implementation doesn't include data augmentation

### YOLO Approach
- **Dataset Structure Conversion**: Original dataset reformatted to YOLO-compatible format
  - Directory structure: images/train, images/val, labels/train, labels/val
  - YAML configuration file with dataset specifications
- **Bounding Box Format**: 
  - Converted to YOLO format: class_id x_center y_center width height (all normalized [0-1])
  - Center-based coordinates (unlike the top-left corner in CNN approach)
- **Image Resolution**: 640×640 pixels (same as the custom CNN)
- **Built-in Preprocessing**: YOLOv8 applies additional internal preprocessing during training

- Less sensitive to plate position within the image

## 9. Conclusion

The comparison demonstrates that both approaches can achieve good performance for license plate detection, though YOLOv8 still has advantages for certain use cases. The custom CNN with simplified architecture now offers competitive accuracy while being more memory-efficient.

Key takeaways:
1. **Architecture simplification** can significantly improve performance through better resource utilization
2. **Memory-efficient design** enables larger batch sizes and faster training
3. **Early downsampling** and fewer convolutional layers reduce memory footprint substantially
4. **Specialized architectures** like YOLO still offer advantages for multi-object detection scenarios
5. **Trade-offs exist** between memory usage, speed, and detection capabilities

For license plate detection:
- **YOLOv8**: Better choice when detection of multiple plates is needed and computational resources are available
- **Custom CNN**: Good alternative when memory efficiency is crucial and single plate detection is sufficient

This comparison highlights the importance of considering resource constraints when designing and selecting models for deployment scenarios.
