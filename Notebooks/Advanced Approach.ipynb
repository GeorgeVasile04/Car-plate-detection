    "# YOLO for Detection\n",
    "For a more robust approach, we use a pre-trained YOLO model and fine-tune it for license plate detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO (You Only Look Once) and EfficientDet are object detection algorithms that can detect multiple objects in a single pass through the network, making them much faster and more efficient than traditional approaches. This implementation uses a pre-trained EfficientDet model from TensorFlow Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of this approach include:\n",
    "1. **Better accuracy**: These models are designed specifically for object detection and perform well on various object sizes\n",
    "2. **Speed**: They are optimized for efficient detection, making them suitable for real-time applications\n",
    "3. **Robustness**: They can handle multiple license plates in a single image\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this implementation, you would need to:\n",
    "1. Filter the detection results to keep only license plates (likely by training the model to recognize the \"license plate\" class)\n",
    "2. Apply a confidence threshold to remove low-confidence detections\n",
    "3. Post-process the bounding boxes if needed (e.g., remove overlapping detections)\n",
